## Project Description

Fast Lane Rentals is a car rental app that makes it simpler for you to pick a car, rent it and pay for it. All you need to rent a car, is to be of leagal driving age and obviously have a driver's license...for insurance purposes. This is car rental app meant to make your life a tad bit easier.

## User Story

```md
I would like an easy to navigate app that allows me to rent a car without
the trouble of going through my ancestory.

Once I have Signed-Up/Logged In, I am redirected to the home page where I can  begin my rental process.

When I have completed my trip and returned the rented car, I will leave a Review.

## The future of FLR

We would like to make it so locals are able to become hosts and rent out their cars using our app.

We would like to make it so when user A gets to a destination and maybe there is a person with our app who would like to rent a car, gets notified and can rent the car from that area.

Make the payment process easier and user friendly.

Have a Calendar that will show when next a specific car will be available.
