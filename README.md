## User Story

```md
I would like an easy to navigate app that allows me to rent a car without
the trouble of going through my ancestory.

Once I have Signed-Up/Logged In, I am redirected to the home page where I can  begin my rental process.

When I have completed my trip and returned the rented car, I will leave a Review.
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
When I visit the website, I can see a homepage with a list of available cars, each displaying their make, model, year, price per day, availability status, and an image.

I can click a "Book Now" button next to a car to book it. When I click it, I'm taken to a booking form.

In the booking form, I can select the dates for my booking and provide my contact information.

When I submit the booking form, I receive a confirmation message, and the car's availability status is updated to "Not Available."

If I'm not logged in, I can click a "Login" button to log in with my credentials. After successful login, I'm redirected back to the booking form.

If I don't have an account, I can click a "Sign Up" button to create a new account. After successful signup, I'm automatically logged in and redirected back to the booking form.

The application is deployed on Heroku, and real data is used.

## Future Development

We would like to make it so locals are able to become hosts and rent out their cars using our app.

We would like to make it so when user A gets to a destination and maybe there is a person with our app who would like to rent a car, gets notified and can rent the car from that area.

Make the payment process easier and user friendly.

Have a Calendar that will show when next a specific car will be available.
